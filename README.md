# [Custom Feedback Form](https://custom-feedback-form.netlify.app/)

### About

Developed a dynamic feedback form application where the **Admin** can create, edit, delete, and view custom forms with various question types and configurable properties. Admins can monitor form performance by tracking the number of views and submissions, as well as viewing user responses. A custom logic feature allows admins to control when and how forms are triggered on the website, ensuring that forms appear to users only when specific conditions are met. The application is powered by **Firebase**, with **Firestore** used to store and retrieve forms efficiently as needed.


### Key Features

- **Admin Form Management**:
  - Admins have the ability to **create, edit, delete, and view custom forms**, each with a variety of question types (e.g., multiple choice, short answer) and properties (e.g., mandatory/optional fields, validation rules).
  
- **Form Interaction Tracking**:
  - Admins can view detailed metrics, including the **number of times each form has been viewed** and the **total number of submissions**.
  - User responses to forms are stored, and admins can easily **view and analyze user submissions**.

- **Conditional Form Display Logic**:
  - Admins can set custom logic to control when forms should appear on the website.
  - The logic can be based on criteria like user behavior, session data, or page interactions, ensuring forms are **dynamically triggered** at the right moment.

- **User Experience**:
  - When users visit the website, the form will **pop up automatically** based on the defined logic, allowing users to fill out and submit the form.

- **Backend and Data Management**:
  - **Firebase** serves as the backend, with **Firestore** used to store and fetch forms in real time, ensuring high performance and scalability.
  - Form data (including questions, properties, and user responses) is securely managed and retrieved on demand.
